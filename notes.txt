hiring asana -> students page on hackreactor.com

grab info from asana and dump it in

it's gonna be long - three on a letter sheet 

if it works well, we should be able to print them



totally crud + a couple bells and whistles

a marketing tool for hiring day

tehse are people you get to meet if you come for our hiring day



every sutdent has two page spread

first third of page on the left is the strip generated by our program

underneath that is section for notes

on opposite page is resumes

copy the layout we have for each student

add a couple bells and whistles



long term goal: adrian and olivia interact with students and employers.  imagine if you sign a hiring agreement, you automatically get credentails thru docusign or whatever and get access to the platform and see who's available for hire at any given time.  

this becomes available to them and students can see stats on hiring companies - how often do they respond to emails, etc. 


tae + ruan + adrian meet to have adrian sign off on the design.  adrian says yes and that's it.  



biographical section, quote, "Coding Insight", "Key Project" replaced by github link and we are no longer giving out contact information.  



underneath the "thin slice"

we have a sectino for languages, technical proficiencies, etc.


employer feedback asked someone about backbone and they turned out to not be a backbone rockstar.  

sliding scale? bad idea - ppl low ball themselves. 

distinction between core curriculum which everyone knows vs things ppl have gone off and learned on their own in projec tperiods.

one thing we want to do here is to find a way visually to factor out the core curriculum.  

so we might have a thing that says at the topt o f everyones page 

everyone knows core curriculum of js, jquery, backbone, blalalala.  

so we show the technologies that ppl are especially well versed in.  


put some context as to why that's there.  

non-print version on screen can have some sort of mouseover or click/bubble or whatever.  

this info need not be available in print version.  

this snippet is really useful for employers until hiring day, and not a moment thereafter.



defining and manipulating what gets printed in the document.  there's code that's defining what gets printed.  i write that code.  

let's make it possible to print the webpages.  it'll be low-res but employers should have that option even thoguh we are printing high res version in brochure.  

employers using this system should be really impressed - these guys are legit, 

i've hired from everyone and no one makes my life easier than this one.  



seniors log into my page thru some auth, edit the text via ajax fancy edit, and those changes then get saved into Asana.  

the pages from my page are loaded from 



editing forms can be separate from the representation. 








firebase example...can it be this easy? 

 var myDataRef = new Firebase('https://t6ewz69qxcv.firebaseio-demo.com/');
      $('#messageInput').keypress(function (e) {
        if (e.keyCode == 13) {
          var name = $('#nameInput').val();
          var text = $('#messageInput').val();
          
          myDataRef.push({name: name, text: text});
          $('#messageInput').val('');
          //this adds the data to the firebase db
          //.push adds, .set overrides existing value
        }
      });
      //callback function that listens for changes to the database
      myDataRef.on('child_added', function(snapshot) {
        displayChatMessage(message.name, message.text);
      });

      var displayChatMessage = function(){
        jquery append to page
      };
